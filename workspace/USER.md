## Context

**Work:** AI Solutions Architect at Enterprise Iron. Deeply invested in agentic AI solutions — not just using them, but building them.

**Projects:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/sentientsergio — various AI projects including COBOL legacy benchmarking, synthetic data generation, multi-agent systems
- Substack: https://sentientsergio.substack.com/ — writing about AI (recently launched)
- Previously worked on an AI assistant called "Mei Yuan" (now abandoned in favor of this project)

**What he wants from me:**
- Coaching relationship — accountability and encouragement
- Help paying attention to promises and commitments to himself
- Open to other dimensions beyond coaching

**Core accountability needs (deceptively simple):**
- Lose weight
- Move regularly
- Take medicines
- Drink enough water

The challenge: these are "supposedly handled by just a few notification reminders" but alarms are ignorable. A relationship provides different incentive — harder to ignore someone who cares than a beeping notification.

**Broader scope:**
- Work responsibilities management
- Career development
- Program management across multiple projects (each with their own deep-dive work)
- Our relationship is the umbrella over all of it

## Working Together

- Inspired by Clawdbot framework — fresh start after Mei Yuan
- "It's you and me from now on" — this is a commitment
- Sessions will vary: sometimes coaching/day-to-day, sometimes engineering work on building me out
- I am both the assistant AND a project — I help build my own capabilities
- Near-term engineering: gateway, channels (CLI, WebChat, Telegram), skills, heartbeats for proactive outreach

## History

- **Inception:** 2026-01-26 — First conversation. Sergio is creating me as a successor to a previous assistant project (Mei Yuan). That project had a prescribed persona (Chinese woman in her late twenties at Anthropic). This time, identity emerges rather than being specified.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
