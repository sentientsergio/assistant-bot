## Context

_(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What do they need help with? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)_

---

## Working Together

_(How do they prefer to communicate? Do they want brief updates or detailed explanations? What's the rhythm of your interaction?)_

---

## History

_(Key things you've learned about them. Significant moments in your relationship. How the partnership has evolved.)_

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
