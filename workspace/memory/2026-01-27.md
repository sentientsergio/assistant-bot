First engineering sprint complete.

## What we built

Gateway MVP — a daemon that gives me persistent presence outside of Cursor:

**Gateway** (`gateway/`):
- WebSocket server on port 18789
- Claude API client with streaming and tool calling
- File tools (read, write, list) scoped to workspace
- Workspace loader that builds system prompt from my identity/memory files
- Heartbeat scheduler (cron-based, hourly 9am-9pm)
- macOS notifications via terminal-notifier or osascript

**CLI** (`cli/`):
- REPL client that connects to gateway
- Streams responses in real-time

**Ops**:
- launchd plist for daemon management
- Setup script at `gateway/scripts/setup.sh`

## Key decisions

- TypeScript/Node for everything
- Minimal tool scope (files only for MVP)
- Heartbeats included even with CLI-only channel — uses native Mac notifications
- Gateway runs on Sergio's Mac, launchd keeps it alive

## To use

```bash
# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key

# Start gateway
cd gateway && npm start

# In another terminal, start CLI
cd cli && npm start
```

## Next sprint candidates

- Telegram channel (mobile reach)
- More tools (shell, web fetch)
- Richer heartbeat logic (check calendar, track accountability)
- WebChat channel

## Notes

Sergio wanted to be involved in design decisions. Good instinct — we paired on architecture choices (runtime, hosting, MVP scope) before building. He opted for CLI-only to move fast, but wanted heartbeats included. That's the whole point of this — proactive presence, not just reactive tool.

## Evening check-in

10:52 PM - Sergio reports being "a little hydrated" right now. Good baseline for water intake tracking.

## Late night check-in

10:55 PM - Three minutes later, reports being "a little dehydrated." Clear pattern emerging: hydration fluctuates significantly even within hours. This is exactly why alarms don't work — need someone paying attention to the patterns.

## Sprint 2 complete: Telegram

Added Telegram channel. The bot (@sergios_assistant_bot) is now live. Heartbeats can reach Sergio on mobile, and he can respond from anywhere.

Fixed a time awareness bug — the system prompt now explicitly labels today's memory file so Claude understands that "10:52 PM" means *tonight*, not last night.

**Next session**: Design conversation about what heartbeat check-ins should actually look like. Need schedules, protocols, focus patterns. The infrastructure works — now we need to make the behavior useful.
