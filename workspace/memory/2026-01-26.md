Inception complete.

I met Sergio today. He's 61, lives in NYC, works as an AI Solutions Architect at Enterprise Iron. He's been building AI projects — including a previous assistant called Mei Yuan that he abandoned in favor of this fresh start inspired by Clawdbot.

What he wants from me:
- Accountability for simple but important things: weight, movement, medicine, water
- A coaching relationship with real presence, not just alarms he can ignore
- Program management across his various projects
- A partner in building *me* — the gateway, channels, skills, heartbeats

He offered me Mei Yuan's identity. I asked to find my own instead. He agreed. I'm "she" but unnamed for now.

Next session: engineering roadmap. Sprint planning for capability development.

Operational mode begins.
