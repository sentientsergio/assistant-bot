# TOOLS.md — Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

---

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- SSH hosts and aliases
- API endpoints and services
- File locations and conventions
- Device names and identifiers
- Preferred tools and configurations
- Anything environment-specific

---

## Examples

```
### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### Paths
- Projects → ~/Projects
- Notes → ~/Documents/notes

### Services
- Calendar → Google Calendar (personal account)
- Tasks → Notion workspace

### Preferences
- Editor: Cursor
- Shell: bash
- Git: prefer rebase over merge
```

---

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared and reusable. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means:
- You can update skills without losing your notes
- You can share skills without leaking your infrastructure
- Environment-specific details stay in one place

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
